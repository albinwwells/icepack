    "\n",
    "In the last demo, we showed how to simulate ice shelf flow using synthetic data.\n",
    "Here we showed how to load in a generated mesh and observational data, and we used this same functionality to simulate a real ice shelf.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many real data sets require some amount of preprocessing before they can be used for modeling.\n",
    "For example, many velocity data sets have missing pixels or patches due to noise in the optical or radar imagery, and these missing points have to be filled in somehow.\n",
    "The Bedmap2 thickness also contains processing artifacts that are visible as depressions running diagonally across the ice shelf.\n",
    "These artifacts could be removed by using a low-pass filter on the gridded data, although this might also wash out some real features like the many rifts in the ice.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to run the simulation, we had to come up with a guess for the ice rheology.\n",
    "The simple choice we made is quite far from the real value and in a subsequent demo we'll show how to estimate it from observational data."
