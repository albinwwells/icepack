    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this demo we've shown how to simulate the evolution of a grounded ice stream.\n",
    "There are more fields to keep track of than for a floating ice shelf; in addition to updating the ice thickness and velocity in each timestep, we must also update the surface elevation and the friction coefficient to account for possible ungrounding.\n",
    "Nonetheless, the basic principles are still essentially the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "Coming up with physically plausible synthetic test cases is difficult.\n",
    "The variables that we can control are the bed geometry, the accumulation rate, and the ice thickness and velocity at inflow.\n",
    "To a certain extent, we can pick the friction coefficient, but this can change in ways that are difficult to predict as parts of the glacier begin to float.\n",
    "Our initial state was far out of mass balance and we let it evolve towards equilibrium, but we don't know ahead of time what surface slope or stretching rate the glacier will settle on in the end.\n",
    "\n",
    "The eventual steady state could be physically implausible for reasons that weren't obvious from the start.\n",
    "For example, if the ice strain rate increases beyond what we expect after a few years of model time, the mass flux at the inflow boundary could be much larger than what the influx and accumulation rate can supply, leading to an unphysically sharp drop in the surface.\n",
    "\n",
    "My point is, if you try to come up with your own synthetic test cases, expect lots of trial and error.\n",
    "\n",
    "The bed elevation we used sloped down towards the ocean; had we instead used a bed elevation that sloped down going inland, the configuration would be unstable due to marine ice sheet instability.\n",
    "An interesting variations on this demo could be to use a bed geometry with several stable pinning points, interspersed with unstable retrograde slopes."
