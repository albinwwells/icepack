    "In this demo, we'll show how to simulate the evolution of a floating ice shelf.\n",
    "The example that we'll show is an example of a model *spin-up*.\n",
    "In a spin-up experiment, the objective is to obtain a physically plausible state of some system from an initial guess by simulating its evolution for a long time.\n",
    "For example, it's common to spin up climate models from a very rough initial guess for several thousand years to obtain a representative state of the atmosphere and oceans for the epoch you're interested in.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our case, we'll use an idealized ice shelf geometry and a rough guess for the initial ice thickness.\n",
    "First we'll solve the *diagnostic equation* for the velocity througout the ice shelf.\n",
    "We'll then solve the *prognostic equation* to obtain the ice thickness at a slightly later time.\n",
    "By assuming a given rate of ice accumulation and melting, we can successively solve the prognostic and diagnostic equations until the system is close to a steady state.\n",
    "In our case, that will take about 250 years of model time and (at least on my laptop) only a few minutes of computer time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The whole simulation can be divided into three parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Define the shape of the ice shelf and get a triangulation of the interior.\n",
    "* Define the initial guess for the ice thickness and velocity, and set a value of the rheology and accumulation rate.\n",
    "* Set the total simulation time and the number of time steps, and then iteratively update the ice thickness and velocity at each time step.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a pretty common workflow for a predictive model.\n",
    "In later demos we'll see some variations on this procedure -- incorporating real data, comparing different physics, and so forth -- but the essential idea is the same throughout."

    "If you want to experiment with this example a bit more, you can run this notebook yourself and:\n",
    "\n",
    "* change the curvature of the inflow boundary or the calving terminus\n",
    "* change the stream widths, thicknesses, or velocities\n",
    "* add a sinusoidal variation in the accumulation rate to approximate seasonal cycles\n",

    "In the next demo, we'll show how to use these functions for simulating a real ice shelf in the Antarctic Peninsula using observational data from satellites.\n",

    "\n",
    "The simulation we just ran uses the prognostic and diagnostic model physics of ice shelf flow.\n",
    "These models successively update the ice thickness and velocity.\n",
    "We assumed that the ice rheology was constant in space in order to simplify things, but this is never true for real ice shelves.\n",
    "Here we'll show how to add a model for how crevasses and rifts affect glacier flow.\n",
    "As ice becomes more damaged, the same driving stress must be transferred through a smaller total cross-sectional area of the ice.\n",
    "We can incorporate the effect of crevasses and rifts into large-scale models of glacier velocity by increasing the fluidity of the ice column.\n",
    "The extent of the damage is quantified in a scalar field $D$ which takes values between 0 (undamaged) and 1 (completely damaged).\n",
    "Following [Albrecht and Levermann](https://doi.org/10.3189/2012JoG11J191), we define the damaged rate factor $A_D$ to be\n",
    "\n",
    "$$A_D = (1 - D)^{-n}A(T)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $n = 3$ is the Glen flow law exponent and $A(T)$ is the rate factor for undamaged ice at temperature $T$.\n",
    "As the damage field approaches is maximum value of 1, the fluidity goes to infinity.\n",
    "A large-scale calving event would occur before this limit is reached for a real glacier, but we won't include this effect here.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ice shelf model includes several functions for calculating the net power dissipation of the ice shelf.\n",
    "The velocity that solves the diagnostic equations minimizes this power dissipation functional.\n",
    "To incorporate damage, we need to create our own function that calculates the viscous power dissipation in the presence of damage.\n",
    "The default function to calculate the viscous power dissipation lives in the module `icepack.models.viscosity`, so all we need to do is pass the damaged fluidity $(1 - D)^{-n}\\cdot A$ instead of just $A$ itself."
