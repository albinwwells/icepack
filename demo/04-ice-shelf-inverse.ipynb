    "In the previous demos, we've come up with some value of the fluidity coefficient and computed a velocity field by solving an elliptic partial differential equation.\n",
    "The fluidity coefficient is roughly a known function of the ice temperature, together with some fudge factors for crystal fabric or large-scale damage, so we know a rough range of values that it could take.\n",
    "Nonetheless, we don't have large-scale measurements of the fluidity coefficient from remote sensing like we do for ice velocity and thickness.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, we can try to come up with a value of $A$ that gives a velocity field closest to what we observed.\n",
    "This rough idea can be turned into a constrained optimization problem.\n",
    "The quantity we wish to optimize is the misfit between the computed velocity $u$ and the observed velocity $u^o$:\n",

    "$$E(u) = \\frac{1}{2}\\int_\\Omega\\left(\\frac{u - u^o}{\\sigma}\\right)^2dx,$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\sigma$ are the standard deviations of the measurements.\n",
    "In addition to minimizing the misfit, we also want to have a relatively smooth value of $A$.\n",
    "The regularization functional $R$ is included to penalize oscillations over a given length scale $L$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$R(A) = \\frac{L^2}{2}\\int_\\Omega|\\nabla A|^2dx.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, let $F(u, A)$ be the weak form of the shallow shelf equations; the constraint is that $F(u, A) = 0$.\n",
    "We can enforce this constraint by introducing the Lagrange multiplier $\\lambda$, in which case the combined objective functional is\n",

    "$$J(u, A; \\lambda) = E(u) + R(A) + \\langle F(u, A), \\lambda\\rangle.$$\n",

    "We can calculate the derivative of this functional with respect to $A$ by using the *adjoint method*.\n",

    "\n",
    "We would expect from statistical estimation theory that the misfit functional divided by the shelf area will be around 1/2, since a sum of squared normal random variables has a $\\chi^2$-distribution.\n",
    "We are quite far off from that.\n",

    "* The error estimates $\\sigma$ are wrong.\n",
    "* We don't have a good way to also account for thickness errors, which are substantial.\n",

    "* The ice shelf becomes grounded on some pinning point and we didn't add basal drag.\n",
    "* I implemented the algorithm wrong.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's probably a superposition of all of the above.\n",
