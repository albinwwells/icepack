icepack is a library for modeling the flow of ice sheets and glaciers using the finite element method.
For more information and installation instructions, see the [project webpage](https://icepack.github.io).
Once you've installed icepack, the directory `demo/` contains several jupyter notebooks with demonstrations of the main features of icepack.
Some of these demos use real data, for which there are some fetching and preprocessing scripts in [this repository](https://github.com/icepack/icepack-data).

See also [firedrake](https://www.firedrakeproject.org), a finite element modeling package used to implement the solvers in icepack.
